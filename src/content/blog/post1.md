Working at Logiframe was both thrilling and challenging. I relished the opportunity to collaborate with over 50 clients from various industries, addressing a diverse array of unique challenges. Engaging with individuals from different backgrounds, including staff, managers, and CEOs, enriched my experience and provided valuable insights.

In my role, I primarily focused on finance and accounting tasks, with some involvement in taxation. Here are some highlights of my responsibilities:
- Providing comprehensive accounting services to clients, encompassing tasks such as collecting financial data, recording journals, preparing financial statements, and conducting analysis.
- Managing Balance Sheet items such as Inventory, Fixed Assets, Receivables, and Payables.
- Conducting three-way matching validation for invoices and their supporting documents, and creating daily payment schedules.
- Offering client support, including assistance with budgeting, forecasting, and guidance on accounting issues as they arose.
- Conducting software demos, training sessions, and overseeing implementation and data migration for a range of software including Xero, Hubdoc, Unleashed, Workflowmax, Vend, and Eats365.
- Leading internal teams in implementing timesheet software and integrating it with Xero, our preferred accounting system.
- Acting as the main speaker in Xero's webinars for Xero Partners in Indonesia.

Notable clients I have worked with include Andalin Group, Gigacover, Gunung Raja Paksi, Cita Rasa Prima Group, PasarPolis, Youvit, Pintek, Principia, and Lucky Bundle.
